# Contributing

As mentioned in the introduction this project is inner-source, any user can develop a composite component and 
contribute it to the repository.

### Where to find the code

The code is on gerrit in the 
[uisdk-composite-components](https://gerrit.ericsson.se/#/admin/projects/OSS/com.ericsson.cds/uisdk-composite-components) 
repository.

### What to contribute

As well as the composite component itself, tests and documentation need to be submitted.    
All composite components are to be tested against the examples from [CDS](https://cds.ericsson.se/#portal/presentation).   
Each composite component is to have a section on the [Composite Components Available](composite_components_available.html) 
page and an example in the Examples section.
